# TeamCodeHard-U05
​
### General information
The company that ordered the database model for its webshop wants to proceed with the next step in the development process. But they have decided to build only a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and instead focus on creating a working devops environment containing two pipelines. One for testing and one for production.
