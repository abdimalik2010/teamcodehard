​
​
Estimate all the stories in your backlog
User management, incl. ~ 3 roles
Groups

Make a plan for the first sprint
Decide when and how we will have our daily standups
Appoint a Scrum master for the first week of the project
The team discussed how we should set up the work and started planning with the visual tool Trello.
We started sprint one by searching good knowledge about the topic. In the next sprint we had a huge
brainstorm where we added as many possible attributes that would help to make as good a database as
possible.
The sprints "way of working" were changed weekly to optimize the best optimum workflow
### Test and Deploy
​
Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.
